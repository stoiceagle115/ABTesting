    <h4 class="text-light text-center">About</h4>
    <p class="text-light text-center"> This goal of this project was to compare different UI designs for the same
        website. These designs were tested on different users using an eye tracking software. The data collected from
        those tests could be used to qualitatively compare our UI designs.</p>

    <h4> Layouts </h4>
    <p class="text-dark"> We created two different UI designs with completely opposite design philosophies.
        <br>The first soley focused on long vertical and horizontal shapes, while the second focused on more uniform and
        box-like shapes.

                        interface
                        <br> - The help button on the interface seemed to do nothing when one of the users pressed it,

    <h4 class="text-light text-center">Results</h4>
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p class="text-light text-center"> Our results did not quite match our expectations for the horizontal layout
            because we were
            thinking that if everything is displayed on one screen that the user would have looked at several items.
            Instead, it seems like they really only looked at one or two items. For our vertical nav bar design, the
            results
            were also a little concerning because it seemed that the viewer did not pay much attention to the “cakes”
            and
            “hot drinks” collapsible drop downs. However, this may have been because they knew these components weren’t
            actually interactive, and viewers clearly looked at all of the food items on the screen, so our hypothesis
            that
            a collapsible drop downs would decrease clutter and focus the user was supported.
